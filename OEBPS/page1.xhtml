      <h1>Seeds Of Wisdom</h1>
      <p>
        <span>A gardener, if he's very wise,</span>
        <span>When it is planting season,</span>
        <span>Will always use the best of seeds.</span>
        <span>It only stands to reason.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Because he knows when harvest comes</span>
        <span>He'll reap what he has sown.</span>
        <span>If he's been careful, he'll be proud</span>
        <span>Of all that he has grown.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>It makes me realize that words</span>
        <span>Are very much like seeds.</span>
        <span>People use all kinds of them</span>
        <span>That seem to fit their needs.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>But, unlike seeds, the words we speak</span>
        <span>Don't stay down in the ground.</span>
        <span>More likely in a fertile mind</span>
        <span>The way of all mankind.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Especially fertile is the mind</span>
        <span>Of every little one,</span>
        <span>So we should be so careful</span>
        <span>Before much harm is done.</span>
      </p>   
      <p>
        <span>A child will mimic what he hears</span>
        <span>And not give it a thought.</span>
        <span>He doesn't even realize</span>
        <span>Just what he has been taught.</span>
      </p>
